# list of reflectors to use and number of pingers to initiate
# pingers will be initiated with reflectors in the order specified in the list
# additional reflectors will be used to replace any reflectors that go stale
# so e.g. if 6 reflectors are specified and the number of pingers is set to 4, the first 4 reflectors will be used initially
# and the remaining 2 reflectors in the list will be used in the event any of the first 4 go bad
# a bad reflector will go to the back of the queue on reflector rotation
